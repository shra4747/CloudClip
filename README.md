CloudClip is a native macOS application that allows anyone to organize digital notes in one central location that is easily accessible from anywhere using a computer, smartphone, or tablet. A user signs in with their Google Drive account, creates a CloudClip session, and starts clipping notes from online material. Notes are organized into multiple sessions, with each session representing a grouping of notes form a related topic. Each CloudClip session is nothing but a Google Drive folder. Because the notes are stored on Google Drive, and not on the userâ€™s local hard disk, there is technically no limit to the number of notes that can be saved. Users can access their notes on their mobile devices via the Google Drive app. To give a real-world example, students who like to review test or quiz material on the day of their exam can clip just the notes they want to review. Teachers can clip notes directly from online textbooks into a CloudClip session, and share them with their students. Users can create as many sessions as they want, and can restore any session from previously created ones after they have ended their current session.
